# Generic Instantiations and Type Argument Inferences

In the last two chapters, we have used several instantiations of generic types and functions.
Here, this chapter makes a formal introduction for instantiated types and functions.

## Generic type/function instantiations

Generic types must be instantiated to be used as types of values, and
generic functions must be instantiated to be called or used as function values.

A generic function (type) is instantiated by substituting a type argument list
for the type parameter list of its declaration (specification).
The lengths of the (full) type argument list is the same as the type parameter list.
Each type argument is passed to the corresponding type parameter.
A type argument must be a non-interface type or a basic interface type and it is
valid only if it satisfies (implements) the constraint of its corresponding type parameter.

Instantiated functions are non-generic functions.
Instantiated types are named ordinary value types.

Same as type parameter lists, a type argument list is also enclosed in square brackets
and type arguments are also comma-separated in the type argument list.
The comma insertion rule for type argument lists is also the same as type parameter lists.

Two type argument lists are identical if their lengths are equal and all of their corresponding types are identical.
Two instantiated types are identical if they are instantiated from the same generic type and with the same type argument list.

In the following program, the generic type `Data` is instantiated four times.
Three of the four instantiations have the same type argument list
(please note that the predeclared `byte` is an alias of the predeclared `uint8` type).
So the type of variable `x`, the type denoted by alias `Z`, and the underlying type of
the defined type `W` are the same type.

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"	
	"reflect"
)

type Data[A int64 | int32, B byte | bool, C comparable] struct {
	a A
	b B
	c C
}

var x = Data[int64, byte, [8]byte]{1<<62, 255, [8]byte{}}
type Y = Data[int32, bool, string]
type Z = Data[int64, uint8, [8]uint8]
type W Data[int64, byte, [8]byte]

// The following line fails to compile because
// []uint8 doesn't satisfy the comparable constraint.
// type T = Data[int64, uint8, []uint8] // error

func main() {
	println(reflect.TypeOf(x) == reflect.TypeOf(Z{})) // true
	println(reflect.TypeOf(x) == reflect.TypeOf(Y{})) // false
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", x)   // main.Data[int64,uint8,[8]uint8]
	fmt.Printf("%T\n", Z{}) // main.Data[int64,uint8,[8]uint8]
}
```

The following is an example using some instantiated functions
of a generic function.

```Go
package main

type Ordered interface {
	~int | ~uint | ~int8 | ~uint8 | ~int16 | ~uint16 |
	~int32 | ~uint32 | ~int64 | ~uint64 | ~uintptr |
	~float32 | ~float64 | ~string
}

func Max[S ~[]E, E Ordered](vs S) E {
	if len(vs) == 0 {
		panic("no elements")
	}
	
	var r = vs[0]
	for i := range vs[1:] {
		if vs[i] > r {
			r = vs[i]
		}
	}
	return r
}

type Age int
var ages = []Age{99, 12, 55, 67, 32, 3}

var langs = []string {"C", "Go", "C++"}

func main() {
	var maxAge = Max[[]Age, Age]
	println(maxAge(ages)) // 99
	
	var maxStr = Max[[]string, string]
	println(maxStr(langs)) // Go
}
```

In the above example, the generic function `Max` is instantiated twice.

* The first instantiation `Max[[]Age, Age]` results a `func([]Age] Age` function value.
* The second one, `Max[[]string, string]`, results a `func([]string) string` function value.

## Type argument inferences for generic function instantiations

In the generic function example shown in the last section,
the two function instantiations are called full form instantiations,
in which all type arguments are presented in their containing type argument lists.
Go supports type inferences for generic function instantiations,
which means a type argument list may be partial or even be omitted totally,
as long as the missing type arguments could be inferred from value parameters
and present type arguments.

For example, the `main` function of the last example in the last section could be rewritten as

```Go
func main() {
	var maxAge = Max[[]Age] // partial argument list
	println(maxAge(ages)) // 99
	
	var maxStr = Max[[]string] // partial argument list
	println(maxStr(langs)) // Go
}
```

A partial type argument list must be a prefix of the full argument list.
In the above code, the second arguments are both omitted,
because they could be inferred from the first ones.

If an instantiated function is called directly and some suffix type arguments
could be inferred from the value argument types, then the type argument list
could be also partial or even be omitted totally.
For example, the `main` function could be also rewritten as

```Go
func main() {
	println(Max(ages))  // 99
	println(Max(langs)) // Go
}
```

The new implementation of the `main` function shows that the calls of
generics functions could be as clean as ordinary functions (at least sometimes),
even if generics function declarations are more verbose.

Please note that, type argument lists may be omitted totally but may not be blank.
The following code is illegal.

```Go
func main() {
	println(Max[](ages))  // syntax error
	println(Max[](langs)) // syntax error
}
```

The inferred type arguments in a type argument list must be a suffix of the type argument list.
For example, the following code fails to compile.

```Go
package main

func foo[A, B, C any](v B) {}

func main() {
	// error: cannot use _ as value or type
	foo[int, _, bool]("Go")
}
```

Type arguments could be inferred from element types, field types,
parameter types and result types of value arguments.
For example,

```Go
package main

func luk[E any](v struct{x E}) {}
func kit[E any](v []E) {} 
func wet[E any](v func() E) {}

func main() {
	luk(struct{x int}{123})        // okay
	kit([]string{"go", "c"})       // okay
	wet(func() bool {return true}) // okay
}
```

If the type set of the constraint of a type parameter contains only one type
and the type parameter is used as a value parameter type in a generic function,
then compilers will attempt to infer the type of an untyped value argument
passed to the value parameter as that only one type. If the attempt fails,
then that untyped value argument is viewed as invalid.

For example, in the following program, only the first function call compiles.

```Go
package main

func foo[T int](x T) {}
func bar[T ~int](x T) {}

func main() {
	// The default type of 1.0 is float64.

	foo(1.0)  // okay
	foo(1.23) // error: cannot use 1.23 as int

	bar(1.0) // error: float64 does not implement ~int
	bar(1.2) // error: float64 does not implement ~int
}
```

Sometimes, the inference process might be more complicate.
For example, the following code compiles okay.
The type of the instantiated function is `func([]Ints, Ints)`.
A `[]int` value argument is [allowed to be passed](https://go101.org/article/value-conversions-assignments-and-comparisons.html) to an `Ints` value parameter,
which is why the code compiles okay.

```Go
func pat[P ~[]T, T any](x P, y T) bool { return true }

type Ints []int
var vs = []Ints{}
var v = []int{}

var _ = pat[[]Ints, Ints](vs, v) // okay
```

But both of the following two calls don't compile.
The reason is the missing type arguments are inferred from value arguments,
so the second type arguments are inferred as `[]int`
and the first type arguments are (or are inferred as) `[]Ints`.
The two type arguments together don't satisfy the type parameter list.

```Go
// error: []Ints does not implement ~[][]int
var _ = pat[[]Ints](vs, v)
var _ = pat(vs, v)
```

Please read Go specification for [the detailed type argument inference rules](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Type_inference).

## Type argument inferences don't work for generic type instantiations

Currently (Go 1.18), inferring type arguments of instantiated types from value literals is not supported. That means the type argument list in a generic type instantiation must be always in full forms.

For example, in the following code snippet, the declaration line for variable `y` is invalid,
even if it is possible to infer the type argument as `int16`.

```Go
type Set[E comparable] map[E]bool

// compiles okay
var x = Set[int16]{123: false, 789: true}

// error: cannot use generic type without instantiation.
var y = Set{int16(123): false, int16(789): true}
```

Another example:

```Go
import "sync"

type Lockable[T any] struct {
	sync.Mutex
	Data T
}

// compiles okay
var a = Lockable[float64]{Data: 1.23}

// error: cannot use generic type without instantiation
var b = Lockable{Data: float64(1.23)} // error
```

It is unclear whether or not [type argument inferences
for generic type instantiations](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50482)
will be supported in future Go versions.

<!--

For the same reason, the following code doesn't compile (as of Go toolchain 1.18).

```Go
type Getter[T any] interface {
	Get() T
}

type Age[T uint8 | int16] struct {
	n T
}

func (a Age[T]) Get() T {
	return a.n
}

func doSomething[T any](g Getter[T]) T {
	return g.Get()
}

// The twol lines fail to compile.
var z = doSomething(Age[uint8]{255}) // error
var w = doSomething(Age[int16]{256}) // error

// The two lines compile okay.
var x = doSomething[uint8](Age[uint8]{255})
var y = doSomething[int16](Age[int16]{256})
```

## Pass basic interface types as type arguments

The above has mentioned that a basic interface type may be used as a type argument
and passed to a type parameter if the basic interface type satisfies (implements)
the constraint of the type parameter.
The following code shows such an example.

```Go
package main

type Base[T any] []T

type _ Base[any]
type _ Base[error]

func Gf[T any](x T) {}

var _ = Gf[any]
var _ = Gf[error]

func main() {
	Gf[any](123)
	Gf[any](true)
	Gf[error](nil)
}
```

## Pass type parameters as type arguments

Same as ordinary types, if the constraint of a type parameter satisfies (implements)
the constraint of another type parameter, the the former may be used as type arguments
and passed to the latter.
For example, the following code is valid.

```Go
func Foo[T any](x T) {}

func Bar[V comparable, E error](x V, y E)() {
	var _ = Foo[V] // okay
	var _ = Foo[E] // okay
	
	// Use implicit type arguments.
	Foo(x) // okay
	Foo(y) // okay
}
```

## More about instantiated types

As an instantiated type is an ordinary type,

* it may be embedded in an interface type as a type name elements.
* it may be used as union terms if it is an interface type without methods.
* it may be embedded in struct types if it satisfies
  [the requirements for the embedded fields](https://go101.org/article/type-embedding.html).

The generic type declarations `C1` and `C2` in the following code are both valid.

```Go
package main

type Slice[T any] []T

type C1[E any] interface {
	Slice[E] // an ordinary type name
}

type C2[E any] interface {
	[]E | Slice[E] // okay
}

func foo[E any, T C2[E]](x T) {}

func main() {
	var x Slice[bool]
	var y Slice[string]
	foo(x)
	foo(y)
}
```

The following code shows an ordinary struct type declaration
which embeds two instantiations of the generic type `Set`.
To avoid duplicate field names, one of the embedded fields
uses an alias to an instantiation of the generic type.

```Go
package main

type Set[T comparable] map[T]struct{}

type Strings = Set[string]

type MyData struct {
	Set[int]
	Strings
}

func main() {
	var md = MyData {
		Set:     Set[int]{},
		Strings: Strings{},
	}
	md.Set[123] = struct{}{}
	md.Strings["Go"] = struct{}{}
}
```

## About the instantiation syntax inconsistency between custom generics and built-in generics

From previous contents, we could find that the instantiation syntax of Go custom generics
is inconsistent with Go built-in generics.

```Go
type TreeMap[K comparable, V any] struct {
	// ... // internal implementation
}

func MyNew[T any]() *T {
	return new(T)
}

// The manners of two instantiations differ.
var _ map[string]int
var _ TreeMap[string, int]

// The manners of two instantiations differ.
var _ = new(bool)
var _ = MyNew[bool]()
```

Personally, I think the inconsistency is pity and it increases the load of cognition burden in Go programming.
On the other hand, I admit that it is hard (or even impossible) to make the syntax consistent.
It is a pity that Go didn't support custom generics from the start.
