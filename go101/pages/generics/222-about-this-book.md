# About Go Generics 101

Starting from version 1.18 (the current latest version), Go supports custom generics.

This book talks about the custom generics feature of Go programming language.
The content in this book includes:

* custom generic syntax
* type constraints and type parameters
* type arguments and type inference
* how to write valid custom generic code
* current implementation/design restrictions

A reader needs to be familiar with Go general programming to read this book.
In particular, readers of this book should be familiar with
[Go type system](https://go101.org/article/type-system-overview.html),
including Go built-in generics, which and Go custom generics are two different systems.

Currently, the book mainly focuses on the syntax of, and concepts in, custom generics.
More practical examples will be provided when I get more experiences of using custom generics.

* show some basic interfeace type argument examples

* ~T is called underlying term

* type argument inference needs more detailed explainations.

* Implementation restriction: A compiler need not report an error if an operand's type is a type parameter with an empty type set. Functions with such type parameters cannot be instantiated; any attempt will lead to an error at the instantiation site. 

* example: how to define an expected constraint?
  * some achievable, some are not.  

* An example show the difference of using ordinary interface and generic constraint

* What does this constraint mean?
  interface {
  	M1()
  	M2() error
  	I
  	int | bool
  }
