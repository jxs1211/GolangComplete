<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>

<p>Firstly, thanks to the whole Go community. An active and responsive community guarantees the completion this book.</p>

<p>Specially, I want to give thanks to the following people who helped me understand some implementation details in the official standard compiler and runtime: Robert Griesemer, Ian Lance Taylor, Axel Wagner, Keith Randall, findleyr, Bob Glickstein, Jan Mercl, Brian Candler, Awad Diar, etc. I'm sorry if I forgot mentioning somebody in above lists. There are so many kind and creative gophers in the Go community that I must have missed out on someone.</p>

<p>I also would like to thank all gophers who ever made influences on the Go 101 book, be it directly or indirectly, intentionally or unintentionally.</p>

<p>Thanks to Olexandr Shalakhin for the permission to use one of <a href="https://github.com/shalakhin/gophericons">the wonderful gopher icon designs</a> as the cover image. And thanks to Renee French for designing <a href="https://reneefrench.blogspot.com/">the lovely gopher cartoon character</a>.</p>
